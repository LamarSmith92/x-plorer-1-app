#EXPLORER1
The exploration of space one satellite at a time. The Explorer1 app tracks the International Space Station in real time on google map. Since we weren't able to find any more usable information to show other satellites we artificially created satellite positions to represent our end goal.

For future development, other languages such as Python, can be used to incorporate more information on real satellites.
